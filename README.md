**Poink!** is a clone of the classical [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) game [Poing](https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3839).

It's also a demake because it was made exclusivily on an iPad using the application [Lowres NX](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/) available on the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lowres-nx-coder/id1318884577) using the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) language.

The original game was made by [Paul Van Der Valk](https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/list.php?list_people=Paul%20van%20der%20Valk) between 1992 and 2002. 7 versions was released during this period.

### The mean-to-be-played version:

1. This version is accessible using the [LowRes NX Coder app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lowres-nx-coder/id1318884577) from the AppStore.
2. And, using a browser to visite the [page of the project](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/topic.php?id=31).
3. Then, using the **Open in App** button.
4. Finally, in the top-right corner, use **Save to my programs** button.

### The "desktop" version:

The code source of the game is downloadable from the [page of the project](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/topic.php?id=31), also with the [page for the editor](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/topic.php?id=136).

Even if the game is playable on the desktop version of **Lowres NX**, the controls are not the best. That's why I also made:

### The standalone iOS version:

This version provide the best controls of the 3 version: available on the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1580770937).
