**Poink!** is a clone of the classical [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) game [Poing](https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3839).

It's also a demake because it was made exclusivily on an iPad using the application <img src="https://github.com/moechofe/lowresnx-poink/blob/master/.github/lowresnx-logo.png" height=16>  [Lowres NX](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/) available on the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lowres-nx-coder/id1318884577) using the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) language.

The original game was made by [Paul Van Der Valk](https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/list.php?list_people=Paul%20van%20der%20Valk) between 1992 and 2002. 7 versions was released during this period.

### The mean-to-be-played version:

1. This version is accessible using the [LowRes NX Coder app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lowres-nx-coder/id1318884577) from the AppStore.
2. And, using a browser to visite the [page of the project](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/topic.php?id=31).
3. Then, using the **Open in App** button.
4. Finally, in the top-right corner, use **Save to my programs** button.

### The desktop version:

The code source of the game is downloadable from the [page of the project](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/topic.php?id=31), also with the [page for the editor](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/topic.php?id=136).

Even if the game is playable on the desktop version of **Lowres NX**, the controls are not the best. That's why I also made:

### The phone (best ‚ù§Ô∏è) version:

"Best ‚ù§Ô∏è" because it includes modification on Lowres NX engine that improves the controls (the touches).

This version provide the best controls: 
- NOT available on the [Poink! on AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1580770937) anymore, It cost too much,
- Availible on the [Poink! on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moechofe.poink).

### To build the android version (note for myself)

1. Open `android-app/com.moechofe.poink` using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. `Generate Signed Android App Bundle`. (output are `android-app/com.moechofe.poink/app/release/app-release.aab`)
3. Reach [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/).
