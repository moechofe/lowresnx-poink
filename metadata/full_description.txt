A breakout game where you don't have to break the bricks. The goal is to destroy the wall and the bricks are here to prevent doing it.

It's a demake of the classic breakout game Poing, made by Paul van der Valk between 1992 and 2002.

My demake has been developed entirely on iPad using the excellent app Lowres NX by Timo "Inutilis" Kloss, available on the app store for iPad and iPhone.
